# Liver_Medical_Image_Semantic_Segmentation
U-Net model based on deep learning to perform semantic segmentation on liver medical images. Students will learn how to process medical images, build and train a deep learning model, and evaluate the model's segmentation performance. The project covers the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
